            Elizabeth Fleming paints as a means of self expression. Her work is a reflection of personal experiences
            filtered
            through an analytical lens. She utilizes symbolism and carefully composed imagery in order to convey her
            truths.

            My work mostly consists of linear and organic forms intermingling with themselves.
            Some of my work is based off of things I see in the real world, then abstracted
            into my own interpretation using colors and somewhat recognizable forms.
            I want my audience to be immersed in the moments I create, to forget about everything
            they’ve ever known and only be within my work.

            Mvtchi uses acrylic paint as a medium focus in her experimental mixed media artwork.
            She layers a multitude of marks, colors, and to build a complete story in each piece,
            like chapters in a book, or events in a day. She prefers a raw approach to emotive art,
            letting the voices of her subconscious become fully exposed, combining many different techniques,
            and whatever comes naturally. Mvtchi also spends time writing poetry and journals,
            leaving each painting accompanied with it's own personal verse, for a deeper expression and
            understanding of the piece. Mvtchi uses art as a tool to heal herself during fits of trauma,
            anxiety, and pain, and to celebrate in life's precious moments of love,
            gratitude, hope, and empowerment. Be true to your art, your art will be true to you.

            Pueblo DePaz is not just an alter ego: it is also a place where one can look back and reflect upon.
            From all his travels, it’s a place where he can call home.
            Pueblo DePaz, also known as Pablo Emilio Ramos-Nieves is a mixed media artist currently living in Orlando,
            Florida, USA.
            His style referred as “Urban Surrealism”: which describes a process of combining strange graffiti elements
            with culture and fantasy. He is finding new ways of how to look at art,
            enhancing the brain of how to think and also shifting stomach organs of how to feel about art.
