            Bill is President of VSAT-ResQ and our lead field technician. Bill has been servicing and
            installing satellite systems since 1989, starting in the hay-day of TVRO backyard satellite
            systems. He has worked through the changing technologies as DBS arrived, two-way satellite Internet
            reached the home market, and VoIP via satellite became routine in hurricane aftermath. His work on
            ships, islands, and 15 states has earned the reputation as a Go-to-Guy wherever the task is large
            or difficult. In-depth familiarity with iDirect, Linkstar, Hughes PES, and Comtech EF Data indoor
            units has proven an asset to our customers.
